Poui trees, known scientifically as species within the genera Tabebuia and Handroanthus, display a variety of colors in their blooms. The color variations primarily include shades of pink, yellow, and magenta, each corresponding to different species within these genera.

Tabebuia rosea, often referred to as the pink poui or rosy trumpet tree, produces flowers in various tones of pink to purple​ (Wikipedia)​.
In the Handroanthus genus, flowers can be yellow or magenta with a yellow throat, distinguishing these species by their vibrant floral displays​ (Wikipedia)​.
The Tabebuia genus has undergone significant taxonomic revisions. It was once a broader classification that included what are now separated into the Handroanthus genus, among others. As a result, the colors associated with poui trees stem from these distinct yet related genera. Handroanthus species are widely recognized for their impressive and colorful flowering, used ornamentally in tropical landscaping for their stunning floral displays that appear on leafless stems at the end of the dry season, making their floral display more conspicuous​ (Wikipedia)​.

For detailed information on the specific species and their flower colors, Tabebuia and Handroanthus provide a diverse palette that enriches the tropical and subtropical landscapes they inhabit.
